I’ll quickly discuss what they are for me, but keep in mind that it may be different for you depending on your background knowledge.\n🟢 Easy integration with R Markdown  🟢 One place for your public slides/analyses/scripts/reports  🟢 Version control with Github Pages  🟢 Free hosting with Github Pages  🟢 Automatic linking and chronologic blogposts  🟠 Customization if fully possible, but not intuitive  🔴 Experience with R Studio  🔴 Less intuitive than, for example, wordpress environments \nI am personally aware of three different packages for creating your website with R Studio:\nR Markdown websites\nHugo & Blogdown\nDistill\nEach of these methods has their own syntax, file structures, and customization options. I first created my website with Hugo/Blogdown, but in the end was unable to easily keep it up-to-date. For me the biggest issue was the file structure which I did not find entirely intuitive, especially when updating my website only once every few months. Distill is much more intuitive to use, but slightly limited in the types of pages you can create. For now it suffices my needs, and I already found some packages that will help me achieve pages similar to Hugo’s widgets.\nBackground Knowledge\nThis tutorial is suitable for you if you..\n… have R and R Studio installed\n… know how to install R packages\n… have a Github account\n… know how to use your Terminal (Mac) / Command Prompt (Windows)\n… have basic knowledge of Git\nI will try and describe the steps as detailed as possible. However, I will not include directions such as “upper-right corner” because user interfaces are known to change. Instead I expect you to know how to work each of the elements/programs discussed above.\nCreating the Website\n\nObjective: Creating an empty/shell website\n\nDistill has excellent documentation available. Some of the steps I describe here will also be included in their documentation with more/less detail.\nR Studio\nInstall the Distill package:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"distill\")\n \n\n\nCreate a new R Studio project (New Project... > New Directory > Distill Website)\n\n\n\nDirectory name: the name of the folder that is automatically created for this new project. I named mine ‘Website’.\nCreate project as a subdirectory of...: the folder where you want to store your website. I stored mine in the ‘Admin’ folder.\nTitle: the name of your website which is shown in the ‘header’ of your website. This can easily be adjusted later on.\nConfigure for Github Pages: please select this option as it prevents some manual steps later on.\nOpen in new session: I chose to start this project with a new/fresh R Studio session, but this is not a mandatory step.\nBuild the website:\n\n\nrmarkdown::render_site()\n \n\n\n\nOutcome: All .Rmd files have now been converted to .html files and have been linked together with a menu-bar. Your empty/shell website is available to you locally in the docs folder of your project.\n\nCreating a Github Page\n\nObjective: Making your website available online.\n\nIn order to put your website online it must be hosted. I like to envision ‘hosting’ as a town (the provider) in an online world. I have opted to use the provider Github Pages because (1) it is free and (2) it forces me to version control my website. Other options are available, which are discussed in more detail in this Distill article.\nGithub\nCreate a new - empty and public - repository. Note the name must follow this convention for the Github Pages to work (cf. the Github Pages documentation):\nUSERNAME.github.io\nTerminal / Command Prompt\nOpen a new terminal at the folder where you stored your website\nInitialize git for the folder\ngit init\n\nAdd all files currently in the folder\ngit add -A\n\nCommit the files with a commit message\n\ngit commit -m \"Initialize Website\"\n\nCreate the main branch\ngit branch -M main\n\nConnect your local folder and the Github Repository\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/SHogenboom/shogenboom.github.io.git\n\nPush the local files to the Github Repository\ngit push -u origin main\n\nGithub\nOpen Settings > Pages\nChange the source of the page to the sub-folder /docs. This tells your Github Pages that it should look for the index.html file in the docs folder.\nTerminal / Command Prompt\nThe previous step on Github has made changes to the repository (CNAME). These need to be pulled to your local instance of the repository\n\ngit pull\n\nWeb browser\nYour website is now online @ https://USERNAME.github.io\nAdding a Profile Page\n\nObjective: Converting your homepage to a profile landing page\n\nYou can make your homepage (index.html) anything you want. I wanted a sort of landing page with basic information about me. In the Distill documentation I learned about the postcards package which is a very easy way of creating profile pages. Before you continue with the tutorial, take a look at their documentation to choose your profile page theme.\nLocal\nChoose a picture or logo you want to include on your profile page\nSave the image in the website project. I chose to create a new folder images with the file avatar.jpg in it.\nR Studio\nCreate a new postcard:\n\n\npostcards::create_postcard(file = \"tmp.Rmd\",\n                            template = \"jolla\")\n \n\n\nCopy the yaml header from tmp.Rmd to the index.Rmd file and update with your personal information. My header now looks like this:\n\ntitle: \"Sally A.M. Hogenboom\"\nimage: \"images/avatar.jpg\"\nlinks:\n  - label: GitHub\n    url: \"https://github.com/SHogenboom\"\n  - label: Email\n    url: \"mailto:s.a.m.hogenboom@uva.nl\"\noutput:\n  postcards::jolla\nsite: distill::distill_website\n\nYou can now remove the tmp.Rmd file again - we no longer need it!\nRe-build the website\n\n\nrmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8')\n \n\n\nTerminal\nAdd all the files/changes\ngit add -A\n\nAdd an informative message for the version control\ngit commit -m \"Add profile page\"\n\nPush the changes so they show up online\ngit push\n\n\n\n\n",
