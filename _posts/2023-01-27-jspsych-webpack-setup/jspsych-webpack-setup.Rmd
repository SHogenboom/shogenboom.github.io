# Initializing a new jsPsych Project

> **Objective**: Create the minimal instance of a jsPsych project.

We use the `jspsych-builder` tool to create a local 



**Local**

1. Create a new folder. This is the parent folder where the new `jsPsych` project will be created in.

**Terminal**

1. Install `jspsych-builder`. [documentation](https://github.com/bjoluc/jspsych-builder). jspsych-builder is a "A CLI utility to easily develop and package jsPsych experiments.". Basically it helps with running/creating jsPsych experiments & plugins locally. I went down this route because I could not get the 'normal' jsPsych to install/build (with npm).

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
npx jspsych-builder init
```
