title: "How I Created my Webpack Boilerplate"
description: |
  When you start a new web-/game-development project you want to get started without having to think of the (minimal) settings to get you there. A boilerplate set-up allows you to get started with minimal additional steps. Creating your own boilerplate has the added advantage of getting started with a set-up specified to your preferences.

## Initialize Webpack

https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/

**Local**

1. Create a new folder. Give it a sensible name like *webpack-setup*. Ideally, this is also a name which you can later on assign to a `Github` repository.

**Terminal**

1. Initialize npm
```
npm init -y
```

1. Install `webpack-cli` as a development dependency. This makes it easier to run webpack commands from the console.

```
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

1. Set package to private
"We also need to adjust our package.json file in order to make sure we mark our package as `private`, as well as removing the main entry. This is to prevent an accidental publish of your code."

```
-  "main": "index.js",
+  "private": true,
```
